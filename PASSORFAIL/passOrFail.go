// Pass or Fail
// Problem Code: PASSORFAIL
// Chef is struggling to pass a certain college course.
// The test has a total of N question, each question carries 3 marks for a correct answer and âˆ’1 for an incorrect answer. Chef is a risk-averse person so he decided to attempt all the questions. It is known that Chef got X questions correct and the rest of them incorrect. For Chef to pass the course he must score at least P marks.
// Will Chef be able to pass the exam or not?
