// Possible Victory
// Problem Code: T20MCHSolvedSubmit
// Chef is playing in a T20 cricket match. In a match, Team A plays for 20 overs. In a single over, the team gets to play 6 times, and in each of these 6 tries, they can score a maximum of 6 runs. After Team A's 20 overs are finished, Team B similarly plays for 20 overs and tries to get a higher total score than the first team. The team with the higher total score at the end wins the match.
// Chef is in Team B. Team A has already played their 20 overs, and have gotten a score of R. Chef's Team B has started playing, and have already scored C runs in the first O overs. In the remaining 20âˆ’O overs, find whether it is possible for Chef's Team B to get a score high enough to win the game. That is, can their final score be strictly larger than R?
